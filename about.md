Hi, I'm **Melvin Goxhaj** — a Computer Science student at Swinburne University of Technology, majoring in Artificial Intelligence, and currently working as a Data Steward / Analyst at ANZ in Melbourne. My focus is on building reliable machine learning systems, data pipelines, and tools that can be used in production environments.

I've had the chance to design and deploy ML applications that serve over 1,000 users, including [StopOdds.com](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/StopOdds), an end-to-end MLOps project where I built inference services with FastAPI, set up CI/CD pipelines, added monitoring, and automated retraining. I've also explored smart contract security with LLMs, real estate price prediction, and deep learning image classification. Most of my work emphasizes reproducibility, data quality, and making sure systems can be trusted in real-world settings.

Right now, I'm especially interested in **MLOps**, **anomaly detection**, and **data validation**. My main tools are Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, and Docker, but I'm always experimenting with new ways to bridge research and production.

## Projects

If you'd like to check out what I've been working on, my projects are up on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}), including:

- **[StopOdds](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/StopOdds)** — production ML pipeline for odds prediction
- **[AutoScType](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/AutoScType)** — type-propagation for smart contract security
- Other experiments in reasoning models, forecasting, and computer vision

I enjoy building things that don't just work in theory, but hold up in practice.
