Hi, I'm **Melvin Goxhaj** — a Computer Science graduate from Swinburne University of Technology, with a major in Artificial Intelligence, and currently working as a Data Steward / Analyst at ANZ in Melbourne. My focus is on building reliable machine learning systems and models that can be used in production environments for a real world impact. 

I've had the chance to design and deploy ML applications that has served thousands of users, including [StopOdds.com](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/StopOdds), an end-to-end ML project where I built inference services with FastAPI, set up CI/CD pipelines, added monitoring, and automated retraining. I've also explored smart contract security with LLMs, real estate price prediction, and deep learning image classification throughout my time as a student. Most of my work emphasizes simplicity, data quality, and making sure systems can be trusted in real-world settings.

Right now, I'm especially interested in reasoning and frontier models. I'm always experimenting with new ways to bridge research and production.

## Projects

If you'd like to check out what I've been working on, my projects are up on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}), including:

- **[StopOdds](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/StopOdds)** — production ML pipeline for odds prediction
- **[AutoScType](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/AutoScType)** — type-propagation for smart contract security
- Other experiments in reasoning models, forecasting, and computer vision

I enjoy building things that don't just work in theory, but hold up in practice.
